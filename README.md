# DBSCAN-
DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm

# Instructions to run
 1.  Compile C++ Source Code -     “g++ dbscan.cpp”                                                                            
 2.  Execute it using - “ ./a.out”  (Input file number which contains dataset like “1”)
 3.  Plot it using - “python3 plot.py” (Enter file number like “1”)
 4. Now to plot clusters close the plot within same terminal it will ask Cluster Number then check cluster number from previous  terminal (Like 5) enter it . Now plot of clusters thus obtained.

# Note - For every new dataset you have to change value of n in “dbscan.cpp” defined in 
                     “#define n 2000” , as per your data set. You can similarly change minp and eps.
